            <h3>Southern 630</h3>
            <p>Southern Railway 630 is a 2-8-0 "Consolidation" type steam locomotive built in February 1904 by the American Locomotive Company of Richmond, Virginia for the Southern Railway as a member of the Ks-1 class.
                At first she worked at Knoxville, Tn. but then was moved to Asheville, NC. to work freight trains on the Murphy Branch.
                It was in Asheville that it met its sister 722. They worked together in Asheville until 1952 when they were retired from service.
                630 and 722 would later be sold to the East Tennessee & Western North Carolina where they became 207 & 208. In 1968 they would be traded back to the Southern Railway for two ALCO RS3s.
                They would pulled excurisons on the Southern until 1980 when they went to TVRM. 630 worked there until 1989 when she was pulled from service in need of work. In 2001 work began and was finished in 2011.
                It is currently owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum in Chattanooga, Tennessee where it resides today for use on excursion trains.</p>
