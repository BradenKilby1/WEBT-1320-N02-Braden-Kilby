            <h2>History of a Alternate World</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>The Everything Universe was started 10 years by me as away to make a world where things could be cooler than they where in the real world and I keep playing around for it over the years, as time when on it was my escape from the real world and life and all their interesting things that they throw up.
                It was my place to let my imagination run wild and do what I thought would be cool.
                After a while I started to make friends on the internet and started telling them about the Everything Universe, though it wasn't named at the time, and they loved it and wanted to jump in with their own ideas.
                Soon after the name the Everything Universe came to be what we called as no one could think of a better name.
                So after 10 years of the ETU, many rewrites, many coming and going of people and friends here is the first time the ETU will ever be on the internet.
                May I give to you a place where imagination and run wild and free while still making scene, this is the Everything Universe.</p>
